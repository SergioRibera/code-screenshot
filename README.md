## üß© Libraries
It provides different options depending on your needs.

- [sss_lib](./crates/sss_lib): The base library for screenshot generation, providing the core functionality for the other tools.
- [sss_code](./crates/sss_code): A terminal tool specifically designed to take screenshots of your code, making it easy to share and showcase your snippets.
- [sss](./crates/sss_cli): A versatile terminal tool that allows you to capture screenshots of your entire screen or specific regions.

## üöÄ Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> At the moment the tool is not available in any store. Please redirect to [releases](https://github.com/SergioRibera/sss/releases) section in order to download.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
> [!NOTE]
> To know how to configure it from a file, you can review the [default.toml](./examples/default_config.toml) file.
> 
All cli arguments can be set from a single file in the path `~/.config/sss/config.toml`, right here you can place the configuration for `sss_code` and `sss`.
